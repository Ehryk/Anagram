Anagram v1.0
================

This Windows console application will return all unique anagrams from a given string as input.

Pre-built binaries are in the /Builds folder. Anagram.exe will be the last (potentially Development) build that was committed with the most features, Anagram_vX.Y.exe will be the last release build for that Major and Minor version.
